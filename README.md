# custom-radio-check

HTML and CSS from my [*Custom radio buttons and checkboxes* video](https://youtu.be/pvqkc4GWqSw).

**NOTE**: while I recommend that you type up your CSS on your own so you understand what's going on, if you copy and paste, select "RAW" else you will pull in strange unicode characters that VS Code won't like.
